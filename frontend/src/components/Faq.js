                    <h5>What is drinks?</h5>
                    <p>drinks is an app to make meeting friends quick and easy. Plan those snap events with a few touches on the screen. Or plan further ahead with the calendar.</p>

                    <h5>What if I don’t drink?</h5>
                    <p>Chances are, if you are reading this and comprehend the text, you do drink. drinks isn’t just for meeting up over an alcoholic beverage but for any social event including the mid-morning coffee, afternoon tea, post-gym smoothie, late night soiree in your flat, the Sunday bbq… or could even be for that gallon of soft drink when you head to see the next Marvel movie at the cinema.</p>

                    <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                    <p>Once you’ve downloaded the app, connect with Facebook and you’re away! Your friends need to download drinks too for you to be able to arrange an event with them. We’re working on phone contacts, LinkedIn and Twitter integration too, so you’ll soon be able to go for drinks with everyone in your social network.</p>

                    <h5>I’ve downloaded the app, connected to Facebook, added friends (who also have drinks installed on their phones) and still can’t get it to work. Help!</h5>
                    <p>Okay, there’s obviously something very wrong. We’ve made drinks to be as simple and easy to use as possible. If you’re not getting it to work, we’d love to hear from you and get the problem resolved. Get in touch via drinks@siliconrhino.io</p>

                    <h5>Which devices do you work on?</h5>
                    <p>The app is designed to be used on smartphones. It's available for the iPhone (iOS 8+) and Android (v 5.0+) phones.</p>

                    <h5>I am still using my Blackberry/Nokia - how can I start using drinks?</h5>
                    <p>Go down to your local phone shop and purchase a better smartphone!</p>
